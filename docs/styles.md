# RiseUp Collective – Visual System

## Palette & Typography (Locked)

This document defines the visual foundation of RiseUp.
These choices are intentional and should not be expanded without reason.

If it starts looking polished, corporate, or trendy, something went wrong.

## Color Palette

### Design Principles

- Few colors, used with purpose  
- High contrast for readability  
- Works on screens and printed paper  
- Feels grounded, not glossy  

No gradients.  
No neon.  
No pastel overload.

---

### Core Colors (Always Used)

#### Charcoal Black

- **Hex:** `#1C1C1C`
- **Use:**
  - Primary text
  - Headlines
  - Icons
  - Dividers
- **Why:** Softer than pure black, easier on the eyes, serious without being harsh.

---

#### Paper White

- **Hex:** `#FAF9F6`
- **Use:**
  - Main backgrounds
  - Cards
  - Reading surfaces
- **Why:** Feels like paper, zines, flyers. Warmer than pure white.

---

### Accent Colors (Choose 1–2 at a Time)

These are **never all used together**.  
Each screen or asset should pick **one accent max**.

---

#### Solidarity Red

- **Hex:** `#B11226`
- **Use:**
  - Primary calls to action
  - Important actions
  - Urgent notices
- **Meaning:** Solidarity, urgency, collective power.

---

#### Earth Green

- **Hex:** `#2F5D3A`
- **Use:**
  - Community care
  - Mutual aid
  - Ongoing efforts
- **Meaning:** Growth, care, long-term work.

---

#### Sun Yellow

- **Hex:** `#E0B400`
- **Use:**
  - Highlights
  - Visibility cues

---

### Color Usage Rules

- Text is always Charcoal Black or Paper White  
- Accent colors are never used for long text  
- Never use more than **3 colors total** on one screen  
- Color supports meaning, not decoration  

If color starts doing too much, remove it.

## Typography

### Typography Principles

- Readable at a distance
- Works on low-end screens
- Printable
- Neutral enough to carry many voices

Max **2 font families**.  
No decorative fonts.  
No startup aesthetic.

---

## Primary Typeface (Headlines)

### **Inter**

- **Style:** Sans-serif
- **Weights:** 600, 700, 800
- **Use:**
  - Page titles
  - Section headers
  - Buttons
  - Event titles

**Why Inter**

- Open source
- Extremely readable
- Neutral but strong
- Scales well from phone to poster

Headlines should feel:

- firm
- clear
- grounded

---

## Secondary Typeface (Body Text)

### **Inter**

- **Weights:** 400, 500
- **Use:**
  - Body copy
  - Descriptions
  - Captions
  - UI labels

Yes, same family.
Consistency beats personality here.

---

## Optional Display Accent (Very Limited)

### **Space Grotesk** (Optional)

- **Weights:** 600–700
- **Use:**
  - Large hero statements
  - Posters
  - Occasional emphasis

Rules:

- Never for body text
- Never for long reading
- Optional, not required

If unsure, don’t use it.

---

## Typography Scale (Recommended)

- **H1:** 32–40px (mobile / desktop)
- **H2:** 24–28px
- **H3:** 18–20px
- **Body:** 15–16px
- **Small text:** 13–14px

Line height:

- Headlines: 1.2–1.3  
- Body text: 1.5–1.6  

Breathing room matters.

---

## Text Styling Rules

- No all-caps paragraphs  
- No letter spacing tricks  
- Bold for emphasis, not color  
- Short lines over wide blocks  

If it’s hard to read quickly, rewrite it.

---

## Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)

- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1
- No color-only meaning
- Buttons always readable without color
- Font sizes never below 13px

Accessibility is not a feature.
It’s respect.

in a pocket,
and in people’s hands.

Not in a pitch deck.
