# RiseUp Collective – Visual System  
## Palette & Typography

This document defines the visual foundation of RiseUp.
These choices are intentional and should not be expanded without reason.

RiseUp supports **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**.
Each screen uses **one mode only** — never both.

If it starts looking polished, corporate, or trendy, something went wrong.

## Design Principles

- Calm first, not loud  
- Easy on the eyes, day or night  
- Professional but human  
- Grounded, not glossy  
- Content over decoration  

No gradients.  
No neon.  
No pastel overload.  

---

## Color System Overview

RiseUp uses **mode-based palettes**:

- **Light Mode** for daytime, reading, printing
- **Dark Mode** for nighttime, long sessions, low-light environments

**Never mix light and dark tokens on the same screen.**

Breathing room matters.

---

## Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)
