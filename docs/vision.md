# RiseUp Collective – Vision, Mission & Manifesto

---

## Vision

A world where people don't wait for institutions to fix things.

Where neighbors notice what's missing and handle it together.

Where help doesn't feel heroic, just normal.

Where people cook, build, organize, and protect each other
because no one else is coming.

---

## Mission

RiseUp Collective exists to help people find each other and do the work that needs doing.

We help people:
- see what's happening in their neighborhood  
- start or join local actions  
- share the work instead of carrying it alone  
- keep going when energy drops  

From the street to the screen and back again.

---

## What We Know to Be True

- Most change starts small and local  
- People don't need saving, they need each other  
- Care gets stronger when it's shared  
- Art keeps people awake and connected  
- Systems change when people stop waiting on them  

---

## The RiseUp Manifesto

We believe in showing up before posting.

We believe a pot of food, a painted wall,
or a meeting in a borrowed room
can matter more than a thousand hot takes.

We believe movements are built by:
- neighbors knocking on doors  
- friends calling friends  
- people learning as they go  
- mistakes, fixes, and second tries  

We don't wait for perfect language.  
We don't wait for permission.  
We don't wait for leaders to appear.

We reject:
- savior stories  
- polished activism  
- movements that only live online  

We choose:
- shared work  
- shared risk  
- shared responsibility  

No heroes.  
No spectators.  
Just people doing what needs to be done.

RiseUp doesn't belong to a brand or an org.  
It belongs to the people who show up.

---

## How We Move

- We start where we are  
- We work with what we have  
- We move at the speed of trust  
- We leave room for rest  

We don't burn people out to prove commitment.

---

## Our Promise

We promise to:
- stay close to the ground  
- listen before scaling  
- build tools that serve the work  
- step back when the community steps forward  

If the platform ever becomes more important than the people,
we've lost the point.

## The SPRK Ecosystem

RiseUp Collective is part of something larger: the **SPRK ecosystem**.

SPRK is not a product or platform. It's the connective layer that holds community tools together through shared principles.

### Why SPRK Exists

Most tools drift. They start with good intentions, then chase growth, metrics, and engagement. They become platforms that serve themselves instead of the people using them.

SPRK exists to prevent that drift.

It's the shared spine that ensures tools stay grounded in the same principles, speak the same language, and serve the same purpose: helping people show up, protect themselves, and act together.

### Core Principles

Every tool in the SPRK ecosystem follows these principles:

**1. People Over Platforms**

The work matters more than the tool.

- No growth hacking
- No engagement optimization  
- No dark patterns
- No addiction mechanics

If the platform becomes more important than the people using it, we've failed.

**2. Action Over Metrics**

We care about what people do, not what they post.

- No follower counts
- No like counts
- No engagement scores
- No leaderboards

Real organizing happens offline. Tools should support that, not replace it.

**3. Calm Over Urgency**

People stay involved when they feel steady, not overwhelmed.

- No outrage farming
- No notification spam
- No artificial urgency
- No doomscrolling

Urgency without panic. Care without burnout.

**4. Dignity Over Growth**

Every person deserves respect, clarity, and fair treatment.

- Wage transparency where work is involved
- Clear language, no jargon
- Accessible by default
- No exploitation

Growth is not the goal. Service is.

**5. Systems Over Hype**

We build for the long term, not the news cycle.

- No manifestos disguised as marketing
- No tech-utopian language
- No revolutionary claims
- No disruption theater

Quiet, steady work. That's it.

### Shared Standards

All tools in the SPRK ecosystem follow these rules:

**No Algorithmic Feeds**
- Content is chronological, newest first
- No ranking, no recommendations
- Users decide what they see

**No Engagement Metrics**
- No follower counts, no like counts
- No view counts, no trending indicators
- If it gamifies participation, it doesn't exist here

**No Growth Mechanics**
- No viral loops, no referral bonuses
- No "invite 5 friends" prompts
- People join because the work matters

**Clear Language**
- Plain, direct words
- No jargon, no buzzwords
- No corporate speak

**Accessibility as Default**
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode supported
- Simple and clear

**Offline Action > Online Noise**
- Drive people toward real-world action
- Make it easy to find local events and work
- Minimize time spent scrolling
- Respect people's attention

## For Contributors

If you're building features or contributing to these tools, here's what matters:

### Decision Framework

Ask these questions for any feature:

1. **Does this help people show up?**
   - Does it make real-world action easier?
   - Does it connect people to local work?

2. **Does this protect people?**
   - Does it respect dignity and autonomy?
   - Does it avoid exploitation?

3. **Does this help people act together?**
   - Does it support collective work?
   - Does it build power, not dependency?

If the answer to all three is yes, it belongs.

If the answer to any is no, it doesn't.

### What to Build

**Good features:**
- Help people find local events
- Make it easy to join actions
- Show transparent wages for work
- Highlight worker protections
- Connect people to resources
- Support offline organizing

**Bad features:**
- Algorithmic recommendations
- Follower counts or like counts
- Viral sharing mechanics
- Engagement optimization
- Growth hacking
- Dark patterns
- Corporate jargon

### Language Guide

**Use these words:**
- show up, take care, work together
- build, support, local, neighbors
- community, shared effort, real needs
- dignity, fair, clear, grounded

**Avoid these words:**
- disrupt, optimize, leverage, scale
- stakeholders, engagement, growth hacking
- thought leadership, revolutionary
- next-generation, platform of platforms

If it sounds like a startup pitch or grant proposal, rewrite it.

## The Bigger Picture

SPRK is not about building a platform empire.

It's about creating tools that help people organize, protect themselves, and act together.

Tools that stay in the background while the work happens in the foreground.

Tools that serve people, not the other way around.

### Success Looks Like

- More people showing up to events
- Stronger community connections
- Effective local organizing
- Sustained action over time

**For workers:**
- Finding fair work with transparent wages
- Understanding worker protections
- Making informed decisions
- Avoiding exploitation

**For communities:**
- Neighbors helping neighbors
- Shared work, shared care
- Power built from the ground up
- Real change in real places

### What We're Building Toward

A world where:
- People don't wait for institutions to fix things
- Neighbors notice what's missing and handle it together
- Help doesn't feel heroic, just normal
- Workers are treated with dignity and respect
- Fair pay is the standard, not the exception
- Communities build power together
- Tools serve the work, not themselves

---

## Final Note

RiseUp Collective and Unionized exist to help people take care of each other and work with dignity.

The tools are simple. The principles are clear. The work is what matters.

No algorithms. No metrics. No hype.

Just people showing up, doing the work, and building power together.

**From the street to the screen and back again.**
