# RiseUp Collective – Tone & Language Guide

This document defines how RiseUp speaks, writes, and shows up.

Tone is not decoration.  
It is how trust is built.

If this guide is followed, RiseUp will never drift into NGO-speak, tech-bro language, or hollow activism.

---

## Core Tone Principles

### 1. Human First

Write like a person talking to people, not a platform talking to users.

- Simple words over fancy ones  
- Clear meaning over clever phrasing  
- Warm, direct, and honest  

If it sounds like a grant proposal, rewrite it.

---

### 2. Grounded in Real Life

Everything should feel close to the ground.

- Talk about people, places, and actions  
- Name everyday things (food drives, murals, meetings)  
- Avoid abstract language unless it’s earned  

Justice should feel lived, not theoretical.

---

### 3. Action-Oriented, Not Performative

We care about what people do, not how loud they are.

- Highlight actions, not opinions  
- Focus on showing up, not sounding right  
- Avoid moral grandstanding  

If it doesn’t lead to action, it probably doesn’t belong.

---

### 4. Collective, Not Heroic

No saviors. No main characters.

- Use “we” more than “you”  
- Credit groups, not individuals  
- Avoid language that centers heroes or founders  

The movement matters more than any single voice.

---

### 5. Calm and Steady

Urgency without panic. Care without softness.

- No outrage farming  
- No alarmist language  
- No shame or guilt  

People stay involved when they feel steady, not overwhelmed.

---

## Words We Prefer

Use these kinds of words:

- show up  
- take care  
- work together  
- build  
- support  
- local  
- neighbors  
- community  
- shared effort  
- real needs  

These words keep things grounded.

---

## Words We Avoid

Avoid or minimize:

- low-toxicity  
- action-driven  
- scalable  
- disrupt  
- optimize  
- leverage  
- stakeholders  
- engagement metrics  
- thought leadership  

If it sounds like LinkedIn or a startup pitch, cut it.

---

## How We Talk About Justice

We don’t lead with big slogans.

Instead of:
> “Organizing for justice”

Say:

- working on real community needs  
- standing up for each other  
- taking care of people and places  
- building power where people live  

Justice is the result, not the headline.

---

## How We Talk About Technology

Technology is a tool, not the story.

- The platform supports people doing work  
- The work does not serve the platform  

Avoid:

- hype  
- jargon  
- AI-first framing  

Use:

- simple explanations  
- practical outcomes  
- background support language  

If tech disappears, the work should still make sense.

---

## How We Talk About AI

AI should sound:

- supportive  
- optional  
- quiet  

Never:

- authoritative  
- all-knowing  
- controlling  

Good framing:
> “A simple helper that points you to nearby actions.”

Bad framing:
> “An intelligent system that optimizes engagement.”

---

## Writing Style Rules

- Short sentences are good  
- Paragraphs should breathe  
- Bullets are your friend  
- One idea per sentence when possible  

If you need to reread it twice, rewrite it.

---

## Voice Examples

### Good
>
> “Find something happening near you and show up.”

> “Small actions matter when people do them together.”

> “This space exists to help people work on things close to home.”

---

### Not Good
>
> “Our platform enables scalable community-driven impact.”

> “Leveraging digital tools to maximize engagement.”

> “Empowering stakeholders through optimized workflows.”

---

## Content to Avoid Entirely

- Callouts and pile-ons  
- Public shaming  
- Performative outrage  
- Doomposting  
- Empty motivational quotes  

RiseUp is about care and work, not spectacle.

---

## Final Rule

If you’re unsure how to phrase something, ask:

> “Would this make sense to someone at a community meeting?”

If the answer is no, rewrite it.

---

## In One Line

**RiseUp speaks like people who show up, care for each other, and do the work together.**

Everything else is noise.
