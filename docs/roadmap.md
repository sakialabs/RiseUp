# RiseUp Collective – Product Roadmap

This roadmap keeps RiseUp grounded, buildable, and rooted in real community work.  
No bloat. No hype. No drifting into platform-for-platform’s-sake.

---

## Guiding Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Street first, platform second  
- Simple beats clever  
- Earn complexity  
- Tools over feeds  
- Organizers over spectators  

If a feature does not help people **show up**, it does not ship.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Before Code)

**Goal:** Lock the identity so the product never drifts.

### Deliverables

- Final README (done ✅)
- Clear core use cases:
  - Find a local action  
  - Create an action  
  - Join an action  
- Community rules:
  - No harassment  
  - No pile-ons  
  - No endless discourse  
- Tone & language guide (next doc)

**Outcome:**  
Everyone knows what RiseUp is and what it is not.

---

## Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** Ship a working home for local organizing.

This is the smallest version of RiseUp that is genuinely useful.

---

## MVP Feature Scope (Locked)

### 1. Community Feed

- Chronological feed
- Supports:
  - action updates  
  - event announcements  
  - short reflections  
  - photos from the ground  
- Text + image only

**No algorithms. No trends.**

---

### 2. Events & Actions

- Create an action with:
  - title  
  - location (address or general area)  
  - date and time  
  - short description  
- Join / RSVP
- Shareable event link

This is the heart of the platform.

---

### 3. Solidarity Map (Basic)

- Map showing:
  - upcoming actions  
  - ongoing efforts  
  - community spaces  
- Click a pin to view details

Start simple. Static or limited markers are fine.

---

### 4. Profiles (Lightweight)

- **Individual profiles**
  - name  
  - location (optional)  
  - interests / causes  

- **Group profiles**
  - what the group does  
  - how to get involved  

No follower counts.  
No engagement scores.

---

### 5. Guide Bot (Very Simple)

- Helps new users:
  - understand what RiseUp is  
  - find nearby actions  
  - learn how to join or create an action  

Can be rule-based or scripted at first.  
AI sophistication comes later.

---

### 6. Support Reactions

- Limited set of reactions:
  - care  
  - respect  
  - solidarity  
  - gratitude  

No downvotes.  
No rage reactions.

---

### Explicitly Not in MVP

These are intentionally excluded:

- Private messaging  
- Long comment threads  
- Trending or viral tabs  
- Notifications spam  
- ML recommendations  
- Ads or sponsored content  

Cutting these keeps the platform calm and focused.

---

## Phase 2: Community Stability (Month 2–3)

**Goal:** Help people stay involved without burning out.

### Features

- Organizer tools:
  - event updates  
  - repeat actions  
  - simple attendance notes  
- Basic moderation:
  - flagging  
  - community moderators  
  - clear escalation paths  

Moderation is about care, not punishment.

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Bridges (Month 3–4)

**Goal:** Turn collective action into real-life stability.

---

### Unionized Integration

- Clear links to:
  - union-backed jobs  
  - worker rights resources  
- Tag actions as labor-related
- Surface job resources near relevant actions

No job board inside RiseUp.  
Just a clean bridge.

---

### SPRK Integration

- Optional wellbeing check-ins
- Support content for burnout
- Encouragement surfaced during heavy periods

Always gentle. Always opt-in.

---

## Phase 4: Smart Support (Earned ML)

**Goal:** Use tech to support people, not control them.

### ML Features (Only After Traction)

- Suggest actions based on:
  - location  
  - past participation  
- Highlight under-supported actions
- Detect burnout patterns (opt-in only)
- Show momentum trends on the map

No black-box feeds.  
No manipulation.

---

## Phase 5: Careful Growth

**Goal:** Expand without losing the soul.

### Focus

- More cities, not more noise  
- Strong local groups  
- Better organizer documentation  
- Support for self-run chapters  

Growth happens through people, not hacks.

---

## Roadmap Summary

- **Phase 0:** Identity, rules, tone  
- **Phase 1:** Feed, events, map, profiles (MVP)  
- **Phase 2:** Stability and organizer support  
- **Phase 3:** Jobs and wellbeing bridges  
- **Phase 4:** Smart assistance  
- **Phase 5:** Careful scale  

---

## Final Check
