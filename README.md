# RiseUp Collective ✊

**Together for Justice, Peace, and Freedom**

## What Is RiseUp Collective?

**RiseUp Collective** is a platform for people who want to show up, organize locally, and do the work together.

It helps people:
- come together  
- plan actions around real community needs  
- support each other  
- and actually show up  

Online and in the streets.

Think **Twitter for change**, but focused on coordination and care instead of arguing.

This is not a debate platform.  
It is a place to move together.

---

## Why It Exists

A lot of people care.  
A lot of people want to help.  
Most people don’t know where to start, who else is already doing the work, or how to plug in.

RiseUp exists to close that gap.

To make it easier to:
- find local actions  
- work on problems close to home  
- turn energy into shared effort  
- and keep going without burning out  

---

## Core Values

### Love  
Care in action. Looking out for each other while doing the work.

### Solidarity  
We move together. No saviors. No lone heroes.

### Empowerment  
Everyone has something to offer. Every voice counts.

---

## The Spirit

- Built from the ground up  
- Led by people, not institutions  
- Practical, not performative  
- Hopeful, but honest  
- Rooted in neighborhoods, not clout  

Art, music, poetry, and storytelling are part of how people stay connected and human while organizing.

## How It Works  
### From the Street to the Screen and Back

### In real life
- Murals and street art  
- Food drives and mutual aid  
- Community kitchens  
- Workshops and teach-ins  
- Protests, marches, and creative actions  

### On RiseUp
- Actions get shared and documented  
- Events help new people plug in  
- Stories travel beyond one block or one city  
- Organizers find support instead of working alone  

The platform exists to support what’s already happening on the ground.

## MVP Vision  
### A Home for Local Organizing

The first version focuses on the basics and does them well.

### Core Features

- **Community Feed**  
  Updates from actions, events, reflections, art, and community wins.

- **Events and Actions**  
  Create and join local actions.  
  Big or small. One afternoon or ongoing.

- **Solidarity Map**  
  A map showing:
  - actions happening nearby  
  - mutual aid efforts  
  - community spaces  

- **Profiles**  
  For people, groups, and local organizations.  
  What they’re working on and how to help.

- **Guide Bot**  
  A simple helper that:
  - welcomes new people  
  - points them to nearby actions  
  - explains how things work  

- **Support Reactions**  
  Ways to show care, respect, and encouragement.  
  No pile-ons. No rage farming.

## Tech That Serves People

Technology exists to make organizing easier, not louder.

Over time, RiseUp can help with:
- finding actions that fit people’s interests and location  
- noticing burnout and lifting supportive content  
- helping organizers see where energy is building  
- making posters, flyers, and messages faster  

The tech stays in the background.  
People stay in front.

## How It Connects to the Bigger Picture

RiseUp is part of the **SPRK ecosystem** and connects to **Unionized**.

### SPRK

SPRK focuses on mental health, motivation, and dignity.

RiseUp supports this by:
- building belonging  
- reducing isolation  
- giving people purpose through shared action  

---

### Unionized

Unionized focuses on fair work, wages, and worker protection.

RiseUp connects people to Unionized by:
- sharing labor actions and worker education  
- pointing people toward union-backed jobs  
- helping turn collective effort into real stability  

**Put simply:**  
RiseUp builds momentum.  
Unionized builds security.  
SPRK helps people last.

---

## Money and Sustainability

This is not built to extract from communities.

Possible funding includes:
- donations  
- fundraising campaigns  
- ethical partnerships  
- movement merch  

The goal is to keep the lights on and the work going.  
Nothing more.

## Final Word

RiseUp Collective is not a brand.  
It’s not a personality.  
It’s not about being loud online.

It’s a **tool for people who already care**  
and want to do something together.

Built with love.  
Rooted in the streets.  
Carried by the people.

✊
